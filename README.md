# Theme 
The theme for this year was accessibility and transportation. 

# Objective
We are tasked with finding out how accessible peopleâ€™s commutes are, aswell as creating custom paths that emphasize accessible stations. Parse, clean, read Toronto station data to ultimately develop a pathfinding algortihm that provides the shortest and most accesibile path.
